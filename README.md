# linear_algebra

Four methods for solving systems of linear equations are compared, analytical inversion using Cramer's method, LU decomposition (my own and a built in function), and SVD decomposition. Analytical inversion was found to be computationally inadvisable. LU decomposition was the fastest method and produced the smallest percentage errors, whereas SVD decomposition was the most versatile in term of the types of solutions offered. These were also put into practice in solving a physics problem.
